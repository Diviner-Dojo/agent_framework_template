## 1. Executive Summary

This document is the authoritative specification for the AI-Native Agentic Development Framework v2.1 — a practical, implementable, AI-native development system designed for use inside VS Code with Claude Code.

### Origin

The framework originated from a research synthesis (`AI_Native_Agentic_Development_Framework_FULL.txt`) that integrated:

- Deep multi-agent collaboration theory
- Structured decision lineage (ADRs)
- SECI-based knowledge externalization
- Reflexive learning loops
- Practical Claude Code scaffolding
- Independent evaluation to prevent confirmation loops

### Evolution via External Project Analysis

After the initial implementation, **7 external projects** were systematically analyzed using the `/analyze-project` command, evaluating **59 distinct patterns** across a 5-dimension scoring rubric (prevalence, elegance, evidence, fit, maintenance — max 25 points). Of these:

- **20 patterns adopted** — integrated into the framework with full implementation
- **16 patterns deferred** — tracked for future consideration
- **18 patterns rejected** — documented with reasoning (preserving decision lineage per Principle #1)
- **5 patterns** achieved Rule of Three status (seen in 3+ independent projects)

The adoption history is tracked in [`memory/lessons/adoption-log.md`](../memory/lessons/adoption-log.md).

## 2. Foundational Principles

The framework is governed by 8 non-negotiable principles, codified in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md). The original research defined principles 1–7; Principle 8 was adopted from external analysis.

### Principle 1: Reasoning is the Primary Artifact
> Code is output. Deliberation, trade-offs, and decision lineage are the durable assets. Every significant decision must be traceable to the discussion that produced it.

**Implementation**: The [Four-Layer Capture Architecture](#3-four-layer-capture-architecture) ensures all reasoning is captured in `discussions/` (Layer 1), indexed in SQLite (Layer 2), and optionally promoted to curated memory (Layer 3).

### Principle 2: Capture Must Be Automatic
> If logging depends on model compliance, it will fail. Structured commands must guarantee capture.

**Implementation**: All slash commands (see [Section 6](#6-command-reference)) invoke capture pipeline scripts automatically. The model cannot opt out of logging. Enforced at the command/tooling layer via [`scripts/create_discussion.py`](../scripts/create_discussion.py), [`scripts/write_event.py`](../scripts/write_event.py), and [`scripts/close_discussion.py`](../scripts/close_discussion.py).

### Principle 3: Collaboration Precedes Adversarial Rigor
> Multi-perspective analysis is the default. Adversarial modes are scoped exclusively to: security review (red-teaming), fault injection/stress testing, anti-groupthink checks.

**Implementation**: The [Collaboration Model](#4-collaboration-model) uses a 5-mode spectrum where adversarial mode is the last resort. The [`independent-perspective`](../.claude/agents/independent-perspective.md) agent provides anti-groupthink checks within the collaborative frame.

### Principle 4: Independence Prevents Confirmation Loops
> The agent that generates code must not be the sole evaluator. At minimum, one specialist who did not participate in generation must perform independent review.

**Implementation**: The [`/review`](../.claude/commands/review.md) command assembles a specialist panel where no single agent both proposes and evaluates. The [`facilitator`](../.claude/agents/facilitator.md) orchestrates but does not render specialist verdicts.

### Principle 5: ADRs Are Never Deleted
> Only superseded with references to the replacing decision. This creates an immutable decision history.

**Implementation**: ADRs in `docs/adr/` follow the `ADR-NNNN` format. The `decisions` table in SQLite tracks `supersedes` references. The [`quality_gate.py`](../scripts/quality_gate.py) `check_adrs()` function validates ADR completeness. *ADR completeness validation adopted from* ***AgenticAKM*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043753*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043753-agenticakm.md)*).*

### Principle 6: Education Gates Before Merge
> Walkthrough, quiz, explain-back, then merge. Proportional to complexity and risk.

**Implementation**: The [`/quiz`](../.claude/commands/quiz.md) and [`/walkthrough`](../.claude/commands/walkthrough.md) commands invoke the [`educator`](../.claude/agents/educator.md) agent. Results are recorded to SQLite via [`scripts/record_education.py`](../scripts/record_education.py). See [Section 11](#11-education-gate) for details.

### Principle 7: Layer 3 Promotion Requires Human Approval
> No discussion insight is promoted automatically.

**Implementation**: The [`/promote`](../.claude/commands/promote.md) command requires 2+ independent confirmations plus explicit human approval. Promoted artifacts have a 90-day forgetting curve (must be reconfirmed or archived).

### Principle 8: Least-Complex Intervention First
> When improving the framework, prefer prompt changes before command/tool changes before agent definition changes before architectural changes. Lower-complexity interventions are cheaper, more reversible, and faster to validate.

**Implementation**: Codified in [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) Principle #8 and referenced in [`architecture-consultant`](../.claude/agents/architecture-consultant.md) anti-patterns. *Adopted from* ***self-improving-coding-agent*** *(MaximeRobeyns, Score: 22/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043657*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043657-self-improving-coding-agent.md)*).*

## 3. Four-Layer Capture Architecture

The research report defined a 4-layer capture stack. This section maps each layer to its implementation.

### Layer 1 — Immutable Discussion Capture (Files)

Every canonical reasoning session creates an immutable discussion directory:

```
discussions/YYYY-MM-DD/DISC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-slug/
  events.jsonl       # Machine-readable event stream (canonical record)
  transcript.md      # Human-readable rendering (generated from events.jsonl)
  artifacts/         # Any files produced during the discussion
  state.json         # Workflow resumption state (for interrupted sessions)
```

| Component | Implementing File | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Discussion creation | [`scripts/create_discussion.py`](../scripts/create_discussion.py) — creates dated directory, initializes events.jsonl, registers in SQLite | **Implemented** |
| Event writing | [`scripts/write_event.py`](../scripts/write_event.py) — appends JSONL events with validation (7 intent types), auto-increments turn_id | **Implemented** |
| Transcript generation | [`scripts/generate_transcript.py`](../scripts/generate_transcript.py) — converts events.jsonl → transcript.md with YAML frontmatter | **Implemented** |
| Discussion closure | [`scripts/close_discussion.py`](../scripts/close_discussion.py) — orchestrates: transcript → ingest → mark closed → set read-only | **Implemented** |
| Workflow state persistence | `state.json` written by commands — enables session resumption on interruption | **Implemented** |

**State persistence** was *adopted from* ***wshobson/agents*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-040139*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-040139-wshobson-agents.md)*).* Multi-phase commands write `state.json` to the discussion directory, enabling interrupted sessions to resume from the last completed phase.

#### Event Schema (JSONL)

Defined in [`docs/templates/event-schema.md`](templates/event-schema.md):

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `discussion_id` | string | yes | Parent discussion ID (`DISC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-slug`) |
| `turn_id` | integer | yes | Sequential within discussion, starting at 1 |
| `timestamp` | string (ISO 8601) | yes | When the turn occurred |
| `agent` | string | yes | Which specialist produced this turn |
| `reply_to` | integer or null | yes | Which turn_id this responds to |
| `intent` | enum | yes | `proposal` \| `critique` \| `question` \| `evidence` \| `synthesis` \| `decision` \| `reflection` |
| `content` | string | yes | Substantive content of the turn |
| `tags` | array[string] | yes | Topical tags for retrieval |
| `confidence` | float (0–1) | yes | Agent's self-assessed confidence |
| `risk_flags` | array[string] | no | Risk signals detected |

**Immutability Rule**: After closure, `events.jsonl` and `transcript.md` are sealed. Corrections require new discussions that reference the original.

### Layer 2 — Structured Relational Index (SQLite)

Stored at `metrics/evaluation.db`. Initialized by [`scripts/init_db.py`](../scripts/init_db.py).

#### Schema (5 tables, 10 indexes)

**`discussions`** — Master discussion registry

| Column | Type | Constraints |
|--------|------|------------|
| `discussion_id` | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY |

#### Ingestion Pipeline

| Script | Function | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|

| [`scripts/ingest_reflection.py`](../scripts/ingest_reflection.py) | Reflection YAML frontmatter → SQLite `reflections` table | **Implemented** (0% test coverage) |
| [`scripts/record_education.py`](../scripts/record_education.py) | Education results → SQLite `education_results` table | **Implemented** |

#### What SQLite Enables (from research report)

- Agent contribution scoring
- False positive rate tracking
- Time-to-consensus measurement
- Reopened decision analysis
- Decision churn metrics
- Drift detection across months

### Layer 3 — Curated Memory

```
memory/
  decisions/     # Promoted decision summaries
  patterns/      # Promoted code and process patterns
  reflections/   # Promoted agent reflections
  lessons/       # Adoption log (learning ledger)
  rules/         # Promoted rules (graduated to .claude/rules/)
  archive/       # Superseded or deprecated knowledge
```

**Promotion Pipeline**: Discussion → Reflection → Candidate Pattern → Human Approval → Rule/Pattern

| Component | Implementing File | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Promotion workflow | [`/promote`](../.claude/commands/promote.md) command | **Implemented** |
| Requirements | 2+ independent confirmations + human approval | **Implemented** (in command spec) |
| Forgetting curve | 90-day expiry — artifacts must be reconfirmed or archived | **Implemented** (in command spec) |
| Adoption audit | [`memory/lessons/adoption-log.md`](../memory/lessons/adoption-log.md) — PENDING/CONFIRMED/REVERTED lifecycle | **Implemented** |
| Actual promotions | None yet — Layer 3 directories contain only `.gitkeep` files | **Planned** |

The **Adoption Audit Feedback Loop** was *adopted from* ***self-improving-coding-agent*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043657*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043657-self-improving-coding-agent.md)*).* It closes the empirical feedback loop — without it, the adoption log was write-only.

### Layer 4 — Optional Vector Acceleration

**Status**: **Planned** — not yet implemented.

Per the research report, the vector layer is introduced only when:
- Discussion corpus grows large enough that keyword/FTS retrieval becomes insufficient
- Semantic recall is required

The vector index would key off stable `chunk_id` values derived from discussion events. **The vector layer never replaces the relational structure** — it accelerates retrieval only.

---

## 4. Collaboration Model

The framework uses a 5-mode collaboration spectrum with orthogonal exploration intensity. The [`facilitator`](../.claude/agents/facilitator.md) selects the appropriate mode based on risk assessment.

### Collaboration Mode Spectrum

| Mode | Description | When Used |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **1. Ensemble** | Independent contribution, no inter-agent exchange | Low-risk changes (docs, config, simple fixes) |
| **2. Yes, And** | Collaborative building — each agent builds on previous | Additive features, brainstorming |
| **3. Structured Dialogue** | Coopetitive exchange with multi-round discussion | **Default for significant changes** |
| **4. Dialectic Synthesis** | Thesis-antithesis-synthesis with ACH matrix | High-stakes architectural decisions |
| **5. Adversarial** | Red team — scoped to security/fault-injection/anti-groupthink only | Security review, fault testing |

### Exploration Intensity (Orthogonal)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Low** | Primary analysis with brief notes on alternatives |
| **Medium** | 2–3 alternatives with trade-off analysis (**default**) |
| **High** | Thorough exploration of alternatives, edge cases, failure modes |

### Risk-Based Activation

| Risk Level | Collaboration Mode | Exploration Intensity | Review Focus |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Low | Ensemble | Low | Docs, config, simple fixes |
| Medium | Structured Dialogue | Medium | New features, refactoring |
| High | Dialectic or Adversarial | High | Security, architecture, distributed systems |

### Anti-Compliance Measures

Complex commands embed **CRITICAL BEHAVIORAL RULES** at the top of their definitions, framing workflow adherence as correctness criteria rather than suggestions. This prevents LLM tendencies to shortcut multi-step processes. *Adopted from* ***wshobson/agents*** *(Score: 21/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-040139*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-040139-wshobson-agents.md)*).* Implemented in: [`/review`](../.claude/commands/review.md), [`/deliberate`](../.claude/commands/deliberate.md), [`/analyze-project`](../.claude/commands/analyze-project.md), [`/build_module`](../.claude/commands/build_module.md).

---

## 5. Agent Architecture

The framework deploys **9 specialist agents**, each with a defined role, model tier, activation triggers, and anti-patterns.

### Design Principles

- Subagents **cannot** spawn other subagents, except the **project-analyst** (delegated orchestrator for `/analyze-project`)
- The **facilitator** (main agent) orchestrates all other multi-agent workflows
- Multiple subagents can run concurrently with true parallelism
- Each subagent gets its own isolated context window
- Agents are invoked via the Task tool: `Task(subagent_type="agent-name", prompt="...")`

### Agent Roster

| Agent | Model Tier | File | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|------|
| **facilitator** | opus | [`.claude/agents/facilitator.md`](../.claude/agents/facilitator.md) | Orchestrates all multi-agent workflows; risk assessment, specialist assembly, synthesis, capture enforcement |
| **architecture-consultant** | opus | [`.claude/agents/architecture-consultant.md`](../.claude/agents/architecture-consultant.md) | Structural integrity, ADR validation, boundary enforcement, pattern consistency |
| **security-specialist** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/security-specialist.md`](../.claude/agents/security-specialist.md) | OWASP Top-10, trust boundaries, auth/authz, red-team thinking |
| **qa-specialist** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/qa-specialist.md`](../.claude/agents/qa-specialist.md) | Test adequacy, coverage analysis, edge cases, error handling |
| **performance-analyst** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/performance-analyst.md`](../.claude/agents/performance-analyst.md) | Algorithmic complexity, hot paths, DB queries, scalability |
| **docs-knowledge** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/docs-knowledge.md`](../.claude/agents/docs-knowledge.md) | Documentation completeness, ADR quality, CLAUDE.md currency, self-healing docs |
| **independent-perspective** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/independent-perspective.md`](../.claude/agents/independent-perspective.md) | Anti-groupthink, hidden assumptions, pre-mortem, alternative exploration |
| **project-analyst** | sonnet | [`.claude/agents/project-analyst.md`](../.claude/agents/project-analyst.md) | External project scout + orchestrator for `/analyze-project` (two-phase: Survey → Orchestrate) |
| **educator** | haiku | [`.claude/agents/educator.md`](../.claude/agents/educator.md) | Walkthroughs, quizzes, Bloom's taxonomy assessment, mastery tier tracking |

### Model-Tier Assignment

Agents declare a `model:` tier in their YAML frontmatter for cost optimization:

| Tier | Purpose | Agents |
|------|---------|--------|
| **opus** | Complex generation and architectural reasoning | facilitator, architecture-consultant |
| **sonnet** | Analysis, review, and evaluation | security-specialist, qa-specialist, performance-analyst, independent-perspective, docs-knowledge, project-analyst |
| **haiku** | Mechanical verification and lightweight tasks | educator |

*Model-tier assignment achieved* ***Rule of Three*** *status with 4 independent sightings: CritInsight, claude-agentic-framework, wshobson/agents, self-improving-coding-agent. Originally adopted from* ***CritInsight*** *(Score: 22/25 + 2 Rule of Three bonus = 24/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-033023*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-033023-critinsight.md)*).*

### "Use When" Activation Triggers

Each agent's description includes explicit activation criteria (`"Activate for: ..."`), following Anthropic's Agent Skills Specification. This guides the facilitator and Claude Code's agent selection in assembling the right panel for each task.

*Adopted from* ***wshobson/agents*** *(Score: 23/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-040139*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-040139-wshobson-agents.md)*).*

### Embedded Anti-Patterns

All 9 agent definitions include "Anti-patterns to avoid" sections with 5 domain-specific prohibitions each. Prohibitions are more actionable than permissions — each agent carries explicit guidance on what NOT to recommend, preventing over-flagging and off-target suggestions.

*Adopted from* ***self-improving-coding-agent*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043657*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043657-self-improving-coding-agent.md)*).*

## 7. Hook System — Safety & Automation

The framework uses **7 logical hooks** (implemented in **10 files**) within Claude Code's hook system. Hooks provide automated safety enforcement and quality automation.

### PreToolUse Hooks (Before file writes, git operations)

#### 1. File Locking + Secret Detection + Protected Files
**Files**: [`.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use-validator.sh`](../.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use-validator.sh) → [`.claude/hooks/validate_tool_use.py`](../.claude/hooks/validate_tool_use.py) (233 lines)
**Trigger**: Write/Edit operations

Three protections in a single validator:

| Protection | Description |

### Hook Runtime State

Hooks use gitignored directories for runtime state:
- `.claude/hooks/.locks/` — Active file locks
- `.claude/hooks/.backups/` — File backups (from backup_utils.py)

---

## 8. Security Architecture

The framework implements a **dual-layer secret protection model** plus additional safety mechanisms.

### Layer 1: Write-Time Detection (PreToolUse Hook)

[`.claude/hooks/validate_tool_use.py`](../.claude/hooks/validate_tool_use.py) scans content at write time for **12 secret patterns**:

| # | Pattern | Regex Description |
|---|---------|------------------|
| 1 | Generic API Keys | `(?:api[_-]?key\|apikey).*['\"][A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` |
| 2 | AWS Access Keys | `AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}` |
| 3 | JWT Tokens | `eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}\.eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}` |
| 4 | GitHub PATs | `gh[ps]_[A-Za-z0-9]{36,}` |
| 5 | Private Keys | `-----BEGIN (?:RSA\|DSA\|EC\|OPENSSH)? ?PRIVATE KEY-----` |
| 6 | Exported Secrets | `export\s+[A-Z_]*(?:SECRET\|KEY\|TOKEN\|PASSWORD)` |
| 7 | Slack Tokens | `xox[bpors]-[A-Za-z0-9-]{10,}` |
| 8 | Bearer Tokens | `Bearer\s+[A-Za-z0-9._~+/=-]{20,}` |
| 9 | Anthropic API Keys | `sk-ant-[A-Za-z0-9-]{20,}` |
| 10 | OpenAI API Keys | `sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}` |
| 11 | GCP API Keys | `AIza[A-Za-z0-9_-]{35}` |
| 12 | GCP OAuth Tokens | `ya29\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{50,}` |

Test files (`test_`, `conftest.py`, `fixture`) are exempt from scanning.

### Layer 2: Read-Time Redaction

[`scripts/redact_secrets.py`](../scripts/redact_secrets.py) provides **15 regex patterns** for read-time secret redaction, preserving key names while masking values. Used when external content is read (e.g., during `/analyze-project`).

*Adopted from* ***self-learning-agent*** *(daegwang, Score: 22/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-042113*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-042113-self-learning-agent.md)*).*

### Protected Files

The validator blocks edits to:
- `.env` files
- `.git/` directory
- `evaluation.db`
- `.claude/settings.json`

### Backup-Before-Modify

[`scripts/backup_utils.py`](../scripts/backup_utils.py) (203 lines) provides:
- `backup_file()` — Creates timestamped backup
- `restore_latest()` — One-command undo
- `detect_conflicts()` — Checks for concurrent modifications
- `prune_backups()` — Cleans old backups

Backups stored in `.claude/hooks/.backups/` (gitignored). Mandatory path containment validation via `pathlib.Path.resolve()`.

*Adopted from* ***self-learning-agent*** *(Score: 21/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-042113*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-042113-self-learning-agent.md)*).*

**Status**: Fully coded and tested (12 tests) but **not yet invoked** by any hook or command. Integration is planned.

### Security Standards

Codified in [`.claude/rules/security_baseline.md`](../.claude/rules/security_baseline.md):
- Validate all user input at API boundaries using Pydantic models
- Use parameterized queries exclusively (no string interpolation in SQL)
- No secrets in source code or committed config files
- Configure CORS explicitly (no wildcard `*` in production)
- Pin dependency versions
- Review new dependencies for known vulnerabilities

Detailed checklists available in the [security-checklist skill](../.claude/skills/security-checklist/SKILL.md).

### Known Security Gaps (Planned)

| ID | Gap | Severity | Source |
|----|-----|----------|--------|
| R1 | Additional Anthropic/OpenAI/GCP key patterns needed | High | [REV-20260219-051846](reviews/REV-20260219-051846-framework-readiness.md) |
| R2 | Secret detection uses `ask` instead of `deny` permission | Medium | [REV-20260219-051846](reviews/REV-20260219-051846-framework-readiness.md) |

## 9. Quality & Testing Framework

### Quality Gate

[`scripts/quality_gate.py`](../scripts/quality_gate.py) (223 lines) runs **5 automated checks**:

| Check | Tool | Threshold | Skip Flag |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Formatting | `ruff format --check` | Clean | `--skip-format` |
| Linting | `ruff check` | No errors | `--skip-lint` |
| Tests | `pytest tests/` | All pass | `--skip-tests` |
| Coverage | `pytest --cov=src` | ≥ 80% | `--skip-coverage` |
| ADR Completeness | YAML + Markdown validation | All fields present | `--skip-adrs` |

**Usage**: `python scripts/quality_gate.py` (or `--fix` to auto-remediate formatting and lint issues)

The quality gate runs automatically via the git pre-commit hook ([`.claude/hooks/pre-commit-gate.sh`](../.claude/hooks/pre-commit-gate.sh)).

- *Quality gate script adopted from* ***ContractorVerification*** *(Score: 22/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-010900*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-010900-contractor-verification.md)*).*
- *ADR completeness validator adopted from* ***AgenticAKM*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043753*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043753-agenticakm.md)*).*

### Structured Exception Hierarchy

[`src/exceptions.py`](../src/exceptions.py) defines a semantic exception tree:

```
AppError (base)
├── NotFoundError      → 404
├── ValidationError    → 422
└── ConflictError      → 409
```

[`src/error_handlers.py`](../src/error_handlers.py) provides centralized error handling that converts exceptions to consistent JSON responses with `(message, error_code, details, status_code)`.

Routes raise semantic exceptions (e.g., `NotFoundError("todo", id)`) — the centralized handler converts them to consistent JSON.

*Adopted from* ***ContractorVerification*** *(Score: 23/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-010900*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-010900-contractor-verification.md)*).*

### Test Infrastructure

**Configuration**: [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) — Python ≥ 3.11, asyncio_mode=auto, coverage source=`src`, fail_under=80.

**Test Files**:

| File | Tests | Scope |
|------|-------|-------|
| [`tests/test_routes.py`](../tests/test_routes.py) | 15 | Async tests across 5 endpoint classes |
| [`tests/test_capture_pipeline.py`](../tests/test_capture_pipeline.py) | 24 | init_db, create_discussion, write_event, generate_transcript, ingest_events, record_education |
| [`tests/test_backup_utils.py`](../tests/test_backup_utils.py) | 12 | Path containment, backup, restore, detect_conflicts, prune |
| [`tests/test_redact_secrets.py`](../tests/test_redact_secrets.py) | ~20 | All 15 secret patterns, non-secrets, multiple matches |
| [`tests/test_simulated_review.py`](../tests/test_simulated_review.py) | 2 | End-to-end simulated `/review` workflow |

**Fixtures**: [`tests/conftest.py`](../tests/conftest.py) provides `test_db`, `client`, and `sample_todo` fixtures plus LLM/slow marker gating.

### LLM-Gated Test Markers

Tests can be gated with custom markers:

| Marker | Flag | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `@pytest.mark.uses_llm` | `--run-llm` | Tests that call real LLM APIs (skipped by default) |
| `@pytest.mark.slow` | `--run-slow` | Slow-running tests (skipped by default) |

The quality gate runs deterministic tests only. LLM-dependent and slow tests require explicit opt-in.

### Testing Standards

Codified in [`.claude/rules/testing_requirements.md`](../.claude/rules/testing_requirements.md):
- Unit tests for all business logic functions
- Integration tests for all API endpoints
- Target ≥ 80% coverage for new and modified code
- Every test must have meaningful assertions
- Test both success paths and error/edge cases
- Tests must be deterministic — no flaky tests
- Test files mirror source structure: `src/routes.py` → `tests/test_routes.py`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_create_todo_with_empty_title_returns_422`

Detailed strategies in the [testing-playbook skill](../.claude/skills/testing-playbook/SKILL.md).

### Coding Standards

Codified in [`.claude/rules/coding_standards.md`](../.claude/rules/coding_standards.md):
- Python 3.11+ required
- All public functions must have type annotations
- Google-style docstrings
- No bare `except:` — always catch specific exceptions
- No mutable default arguments
- Prefer `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`
- `snake_case` functions, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` constants
- Maximum function length: ~50 lines (guideline)
- Single responsibility per function

## 10. Learning Architecture — Three Nested Loops

The research report defined three nested improvement loops. The framework implements all three, though the micro loop trigger mechanism is still planned.

### Micro Loop — Per-Discussion Reflections

**Trigger**: After each discussion resolution
**Cycle**: Agent writes structured reflection → reflection inserted into SQLite → candidate improvement rule generated

| Component | Implementing File | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Reflection template | [`docs/templates/reflection-template.md`](templates/reflection-template.md) | **Implemented** |
| Reflection ingestion | [`scripts/ingest_reflection.py`](../scripts/ingest_reflection.py) — parses YAML frontmatter → SQLite `reflections` table | **Implemented** (0% test coverage) |
| Trigger mechanism | No automated trigger exists — agents must be explicitly prompted to reflect | **Planned** |

### Meso Loop — Sprint Retrospectives

**Trigger**: End of sprint (developer-initiated)
**Command**: [`/retro`](../.claude/commands/retro.md)

Produces:
- Reopened decisions
- Override frequency
- Frequent issue tags
- Time-to-resolution stats
- Adoption pattern evaluation (PENDING → CONFIRMED/REVERTED)

**Status**: **Implemented** (command exists, not yet executed)

### Macro Loop — Quarterly Framework Evolution

**Trigger**: Quarterly (developer-initiated)
**Command**: [`/meta-review`](../.claude/commands/meta-review.md)

Produces:
- Agent effectiveness scoring
- Drift analysis
- Rule update candidates
- Decision churn index

**Status**: **Implemented** (command exists, not yet executed)

### Adoption Audit Feedback Loop

The adoption log at [`memory/lessons/adoption-log.md`](../memory/lessons/adoption-log.md) tracks a lifecycle for every adopted pattern:

```
PENDING → CONFIRMED (with evidence) or REVERTED (with reason)
```

Evaluation happens at the next `/retro` or `/meta-review` cycle. The question: *"Has this adoption produced measurable benefit, or is it inert/harmful?"*

*Adopted from* ***self-improving-coding-agent*** *(Score: 20/25,* [*ANALYSIS-20260219-043657*](reviews/ANALYSIS-20260219-043657-self-improving-coding-agent.md)*).*

### Learning Model

Learning operates at two levels (from research report):
- **Single-loop**: Threshold adjustments, parameter tuning within existing rules
- **Double-loop**: Criteria redefinition — changing what counts as "good" based on accumulated evidence

---

## 11. Education Gate

The education gate ensures developers understand AI-generated code before it's merged. Proportional to complexity and risk.

### Four-Step Gate Workflow

1. **Walkthrough** — Guided explanation of the code via [`/walkthrough`](../.claude/commands/walkthrough.md)
2. **Quiz** — Bloom's taxonomy assessment via [`/quiz`](../.claude/commands/quiz.md)
3. **Explain-back** — Developer explains the code in their own words
4. **Merge** — Only after steps 1–3 complete

### Assessment Dimensions (Bloom's Taxonomy)

| Level | Description | Question Type |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Remember | Recall facts | recall |
| Understand | Explain concepts | walkthrough |
| Apply | Use in new situations | — |
| Analyze | Break down components | debug-scenario |
| Evaluate | Make judgments | change-impact |
| Create | Produce new work | explain-back |

### Configuration

From [`.claude/rules/review_gates.md`](../.claude/rules/review_gates.md):
- Quiz pass threshold: **70%**
- Bloom's level mix: 60–70% Understand/Apply, 30–40% Analyze/Evaluate
- At least 1 debug scenario and 1 change-impact question per quiz
- Educational intensity adapts to demonstrated competence (scaffolding fades)

### Implementation

| Component | Implementing File | Status |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Quiz command | [`.claude/commands/quiz.md`](../.claude/commands/quiz.md) | **Implemented** |
| Walkthrough command | [`.claude/commands/walkthrough.md`](../.claude/commands/walkthrough.md) | **Implemented** |
| Educator agent | [`.claude/agents/educator.md`](../.claude/agents/educator.md) (haiku tier) | **Implemented** |
| Result recording | [`scripts/record_education.py`](../scripts/record_education.py) → SQLite `education_results` table | **Implemented** |
| Competence trend analysis | SQLite queries across `education_results` | **Implemented** (schema ready) |

---

## 12. External Project Analysis & Onboarding

### Outward-Facing Analysis

The framework can analyze external projects to discover adoptable patterns.

#### `/analyze-project` — Pattern Discovery

**Command**: [`.claude/commands/analyze-project.md`](../.claude/commands/analyze-project.md) (327 lines)
**Agent**: [`.claude/agents/project-analyst.md`](../.claude/agents/project-analyst.md) (255 lines)

**Two-Phase Process**:
1. **Phase 1 — Survey**: The `project-analyst` scouts the target project, identifying candidate patterns
2. **Phase 2 — Orchestrate**: Domain specialists (architecture, security, QA, independent) evaluate each pattern

**5-Dimension Scoring Rubric**:

| Dimension | Question | Scale |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Prevalence | How widely used is this pattern? | 1–5 |
| Elegance | How clean is the implementation? | 1–5 |
| Evidence | Is there empirical evidence it works? | 1–5 |
| Fit | How well does it fit our framework? | 1–5 |
| Maintenance | How maintainable is the adoption? | 1–5 |

- Patterns scoring **≥ 20/25** → Recommended for adoption
- Patterns scoring **15–19** → Deferred (tracked for future consideration)
- Patterns scoring **< 15** → Rejected (documented with reasoning)

**Rule of Three**: When a pattern is seen in 3+ independent projects, it receives a +2 bonus to its score. Three sightings confirm a pattern is real, not coincidental.

**Template**: [`docs/templates/project-analysis-template.md`](templates/project-analysis-template.md)

#### `/discover-projects` — GitHub Search

**Command**: [`.claude/commands/discover-projects.md`](../.claude/commands/discover-projects.md) (57 lines)

Uses `gh` CLI to search GitHub for candidate projects matching specified criteria.

### Inward-Facing Onboarding

#### `/onboard` — Project Takeover Protocol

**Command**: [`.claude/commands/onboard.md`](../.claude/commands/onboard.md) (127 lines)

Five steps:
1. Codebase mapping
2. Reverse-engineered ADR creation
3. Pattern extraction
4. Baseline test generation
5. First structured discussion

### Analysis Track Record

As of 2026-02-19, 7 projects analyzed → 59 patterns evaluated → 20 adopted. Two patterns achieved Rule of Three:

| Pattern | Sightings | Projects | Final Score |
|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Model-Tier Agent Assignment | 4 | CritInsight, claude-agentic, wshobson, self-improving | 24/25 |
| Session Continuity Hooks | 3 | ContractorVerification, CritInsight, claude-agentic | 23/25 |

## 13. Reference Implementation — Todo API

The framework includes a sample Todo API that demonstrates all framework patterns in practice. Reviews, tests, and discussions have all been exercised against this real code.

### Architecture

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| [`src/main.py`](../src/main.py) | 32 | FastAPI app with lifespan pattern, TodoDatabase creation, error handler registration |
| [`src/routes.py`](../src/routes.py) | 67 | 5 CRUD endpoints: list (with `?completed` filter), create, get, update, delete |
| [`src/models.py`](../src/models.py) | 29 | 3 Pydantic models: `TodoCreate`, `TodoUpdate` (input), `TodoResponse` (output) |
| [`src/database.py`](../src/database.py) | 97 | `TodoDatabase` class wrapping SQLite with WAL mode, full CRUD |
| [`src/exceptions.py`](../src/exceptions.py) | 64 | `AppError` base + `NotFoundError`, `ValidationError`, `ConflictError` |
| [`src/error_handlers.py`](../src/error_handlers.py) | 47 | Centralized handlers: `AppError` → structured JSON, generic `Exception` → 500 |

### Patterns Demonstrated

- **FastAPI lifespan context manager** for database lifecycle
- **Pydantic model separation** (input vs. output models)
- **SQLite with WAL mode** for concurrent reads
- **Structured exception hierarchy** with semantic error codes
- **Centralized error handling** (routes raise exceptions, handler converts to JSON)
- **Dependency injection** via FastAPI's `Depends()`
- **15 async tests** spanning all endpoints and error paths

### API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/todos` | List todos (optional `?completed=true/false` filter) |
| POST | `/todos` | Create a new todo |
| GET | `/todos/{todo_id}` | Get a specific todo |
| PATCH | `/todos/{todo_id}` | Update a todo |
| DELETE | `/todos/{todo_id}` | Delete a todo |

### Review History

The Todo API has been through structured multi-agent review:
- [REV-20260218-230957](reviews/REV-20260218-230957.md) — 5 agents, 7 turns. Verdict: approve-with-changes. Required: Replace global `_db` → `Depends()`, add `Path(gt=0)`, add whitespace validation.

---

### Implemented but Unused / Under-Tested

| Feature | Files | Gap |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Backup-before-modify utilities | `scripts/backup_utils.py` (203 lines, 12 tests) | Fully coded and tested but **never invoked** by any hook or command |
| Reflection ingestion | `scripts/ingest_reflection.py` (102 lines) | Script exists, **0% test coverage**, no documented invocation path |
| Quality gate script | `scripts/quality_gate.py` (223 lines) | Works via hook but has **0% direct test coverage** |
| Close discussion | `scripts/close_discussion.py` (66 lines) | ~33% test coverage |
| Layer 3 memory directories | `memory/decisions/`, `patterns/`, `reflections/`, `rules/` | Directories exist but contain only `.gitkeep` — **no promotions yet** |
| `/retro` and `/meta-review` commands | `.claude/commands/retro.md`, `meta-review.md` | Commands defined but **never executed** |

### Planned — Roadmap

#### From Readiness Review ([REV-20260219-051846](reviews/REV-20260219-051846-framework-readiness.md))

| ID | Finding | Severity | Description |
|----|---------|----------|-------------|
| R1 | Additional secret patterns | High | Add Anthropic, OpenAI, GCP key patterns to write-time detection |
| R2 | Escalate detection permission | Medium | Change secret detection from `ask` to `deny` |
| R3 | `ingest_reflection.py` tests | High | Add tests (0% coverage) |
| R4 | `quality_gate.py` tests | High | Add tests (0% coverage) |
| R5 | `close_discussion.py` coverage | Medium | Increase from ~33% to ≥ 80% |
| R6 | Additional ruff rules | Medium | Add B, ANN rules per coding_standards.md |
| R7 | Quality gate silent-pass fix | High | Fix silent-pass on empty test directories |
| R8 | Project-analyst subagent docs | Medium | Resolve spawning constraint vs CLAUDE.md documentation |
| R9 | CLAUDE.md drift fixes | Medium | Update secret count (6→12), memory directory layout |
| R10 | Document `ingest_reflection.py` path | Medium | Document invocation path or mark as planned |
| R11 | Dual-layer security ADR | Low | Document the dual-layer secret architecture decision |
| R12 | ADR-0001 cleanup | Low | Fix stale `discussion_id: null` |

#### From Gap Analysis

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Micro-loop reflection trigger | Automated mechanism to prompt agents to reflect after discussions | Medium |
| Layer 4 vector acceleration | Optional semantic retrieval when corpus grows large | Low |
| Cross-platform session hooks | `.sh` equivalents for PowerShell-only hooks | Medium |
| Spec template for `/plan` | Referenced by command but doesn't exist in `docs/templates/` | Low |
| SQLite migration infrastructure | No schema migration mechanism for `evaluation.db` | Low |
| API pagination | List endpoint lacks pagination (flagged in review) | Low |
| Backup integration | Wire `backup_utils.py` into hooks/commands | Medium |
| Scripts coverage measurement | `pyproject.toml` coverage source is `src/` only — scripts excluded | Medium |
